# nwjssdkhelper
Helper code for the NW.js SDK

Include in your ```index.html``` before other javascript files:
```
    <script src="nwjssdkhelper/nwjssdkhelper.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Basically, the code opens the debugging tools everytime you run the project. It also registers the keycombination ```ctl+r``` to restart your project.
